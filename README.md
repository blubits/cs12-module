# CS12 Lecture Notes

Lecture notes for Computer Science 12, the second programming course for CS majors in the University of the Philippines - Diliman.

# Extra topics?

There's a lot of stuff here that's a bit beyond the scope of CS 12; most of the info I've added is just there in case you're curious about how things work, or because it's a handy feature that will help you save time in coding.

# Comments?

Comments, suggestions, feedback, and pull requests are welcome, especially if you spot an error in the notes. Simply message me on whatever channel you're connected with me on or, if you know how to do it, create a pull request.
